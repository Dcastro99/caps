 # LAB: Event Driven Applications

**CAPS Phase 1**: Begin the build of an application for a product called **CAPS** - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, weâ€™ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. **CAPS** will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, each vendor will be notified that their customers received what they purchased.
